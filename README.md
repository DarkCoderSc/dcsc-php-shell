# DCSC PHP Shell

Contain only the required tools for solving some CTF (IMOO).

Coded for my needs during my PWK/OSCP journey. Shared because it might help ;)

I'm aware that the code could be considered as quite dirty and probably not the most optimized possible. 
I will on my free time continue to improve that script and add some feature progressively (depending on my ponctual needs)

Some old PHP functions are used to be sure this shell is compatible with most PHP versions. (4+)

The script use some ripped CSS from Bootstrap. I tried to minimize the size of the CSS, most CSS code is not necessary but just
fancy. 

Don't forget to change the password !
